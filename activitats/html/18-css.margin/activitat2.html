            <p class="">As has been the case for many years, jobs, or forms of employment wherein employees perform 
                a service or duty in exchange for financial compensation, play a prominent role in society. Furthermore,
                 all jobs—even those of seemingly little significance—are important, <a href="#" class="paragraf__enllas">they simply wouldn't exist if their
                  specific responsibilities weren't of value to employers (companies or persons that pay others for their work),

                     all of whom can be referred to simply as "Doctor (Name)." Dentists (mouth/teeth doctors), dermatologists (skin doctors), 
                     and psychiatrists (mental-health doctors) are just a few examples of the many different types of doctors.</p>
